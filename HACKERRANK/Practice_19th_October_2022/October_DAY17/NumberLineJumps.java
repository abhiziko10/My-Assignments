/*
You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act. you are given two
kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive
infinity)
The first kangaroo starts at location Ã¦l and moves at a rate of vl meters per jump.
The second kangaroo starts at location x2 and moves at a rate of v2 meters per jump.
You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time
as part of the show. Ifit is possible, return YES, otherwise return NO.
Example
l = 2
vl = 1
2=1
v2=2
After one jump, they are both at z = 3. (1+ vl =2+1. a2+v2 = 1 +2), so the
answer is YES.
Function Description
Complete the function kangaroo in the editor below.
kangaroo has the following parameter(s):
int x1, int v1: starting position and jump distance for kangaroo 1
